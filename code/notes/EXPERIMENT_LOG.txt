Integrator: LeapFrog (sympletic)
dt, steps, softening: dt = 2e-4, timesteps = 5000, softening = 0.0

Scenario:
Two-body Sun–planet system in 2D.
Planet initialized on circular orbit at r = 1 with v = 2π.
Sun given compensating velocity to ensure total linear momentum ≈ 0.
Used as a baseline validation test for conservation laws.

Expected:

Total energy should exhibit small bounded oscillations with no secular drift.
COM-frame angular momentum should be conserved to machine precision.
Linear momentum should remain constant (center of mass stationary).

Observed max energy drift: 

1e-11 (bounded oscillation, no secular trend)

Observed max L_com drift:

1e-15 (machine precision)

Observed max |P| drift:

Not explicitly measured in this test.
COM remains stationary, implying |P| ≈ 0 within numerical precision.

Next action: Add explicit linear momentum and center-of-mass drift diagnostics to complete Phase 2 validation.

Expected:

Integrator: Euler (Forward Euler)
dt, steps, softening: dt = 2e-4, steps = 5000, softening = 0.0

Scenario:
Two-body Sun–planet system, near-circular orbit.
Same initial conditions as Leapfrog comparison.

Expected:
- Energy: secular (linear) drift

Conclusion:
Euler integrator exhibits expected non-conservation of invariants.
Results clearly contrast with Leapfrog and validate diagnostic framework.

Next action:
Use Leapfrog as default integrator.
Proceed to Phase 3 (3D extension).







DATE: 16/12/25
Integrator: Leapfrog (Velocity Verlet, Symplectic)
dt, steps, softening: dt = 2e-4, steps = 5000, softening = 0.0

Scenario:
Two-body Sun–planet system in full 3D.
Initial conditions define a planar near-circular orbit (z = 0, vz = 0), used to validate the 3D extension against the known 2D solution.

Expected:
- Energy: bounded oscillations, no secular drift
- Angular momentum (COM frame): conserved to machine precision
- Linear momentum: 0 up to floating-point noise
- COM position: no systematic drift


Observed max relative energy drift: 1.6 × 10⁻⁹

Observed max angular momentum drift: 2.5 × 10⁻¹⁵

Observed max |P(t)|: 3.5 × 10⁻¹⁷

Observed COM drift: 1.2 × 10⁻¹⁷

Conclusion:
Leapfrog integrator preserves physical invariants in 3D to machine precision.
Energy shows bounded oscillations characteristic of symplectic integration.
Angular momentum magnitude, linear momentum, and center-of-mass remain conserved up to floating-point error, validating the 3D physics, integrator updates, and diagnostic framework.

Next action:
Extend validation with non-planar 3D orbits (z, vz != 0).






DATE: 16/12/25
Integrator: Leapfrog (Velocity Verlet, Symplectic)
dt, steps, softening: dt = 2e-4, steps = 5000, softening = 0.0

Scenario:
Two-body Sun–planet system in full 3D with non-planar initial conditions.
Planet initialized with a small vertical velocity component (vz ≠ 0), producing a tilted 3D orbit.

Expected:

Energy: bounded oscillatory error (no secular drift)

Angular momentum: conserved in magnitude

Linear momentum: small constant offset due to initial conditions

Center-of-mass: linear drift consistent with non-zero total momentum

Observed max relative energy drift: 2.0 × 10⁻⁹

Observed max angular momentum drift: 6.0 × 10⁻¹⁵

Observed max |P(t)|: 1.0 × 10⁻⁴

Observed COM drift: 1.0 × 10⁻⁴

Conclusion:
Leapfrog integrator correctly preserves energy and angular momentum magnitude in fully 3D motion.
The system evolves on a tilted orbit while maintaining bounded energy error and machine-precision angular momentum conservation.
Observed linear momentum and center-of-mass drift are consistent with the intentionally non-zero initial total momentum.
This validates the full 3D physics implementation, integrator updates, and diagnostic framework.

Next action:
Proceed to Phase 4 (Barnes–Hut solver development).
