dt, steps, softening: 

dt = 2e-4
timesteps = 5000
softening = 0.0

Scenario:

Two-body Sun–planet system in 2D.
Planet initialized on circular orbit at r = 1 with v = 2π.
Sun given compensating velocity to ensure total linear momentum ≈ 0.
Used as a baseline validation test for conservation laws.

Expected:

Total energy should exhibit small bounded oscillations with no secular drift.
COM-frame angular momentum should be conserved to machine precision.
Linear momentum should remain constant (center of mass stationary).

Observed max energy drift: 

1e-11 (bounded oscillation, no secular trend)

Observed max L_com drift:

1e-15 (machine precision)

Observed max |P| drift:

Not explicitly measured in this test.
COM remains stationary, implying |P| ≈ 0 within numerical precision.

Next action: Add explicit linear momentum and center-of-mass drift diagnostics to complete Phase 2 validation.
